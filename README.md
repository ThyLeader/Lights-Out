# Lights Out

This is a game written in my free time, that mimics the handheld version.

It is very simple, and extremely unoptimized. I began this project when I knew very little about Go

Currently working on AI to complete the game for you, so check back often.

Note: there are two files, one that will run in terminal, and one that I currently use to run in Google AppEngine [here](http://lights-outg.appspot.com).

If you would like to run it in terminal, download LightsTerminal.go, navigate to the enclosing folder in terminal, and type go run LightsTerminal.go
